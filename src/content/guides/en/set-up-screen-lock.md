  - question: "What happens if I forget my PIN or password?"
    answer: "If you forget your PIN, you will need to reset your phone, which may erase your data. That is why it is important to write down your PIN and keep it in a safe place at home. On iPhone, you can restore from an iCloud backup after resetting."
  - question: "Which is more secure: a PIN, a pattern, or a fingerprint?"
    answer: "A fingerprint is the most secure and convenient option because it cannot be guessed. A 6-digit PIN is more secure than a 4-digit one. A pattern lock is the least secure because someone watching you could memorise it."
  - question: "Will I need to enter my PIN every time I use my phone?"
    answer: "You will need to enter it each time you wake up your phone after the screen turns off. If you set up fingerprint or face recognition, you can unlock your phone by simply touching the sensor or looking at the screen, which is faster."
  - question: "Can someone unlock my phone while I am sleeping?"
    answer: "If you use fingerprint unlock, someone could potentially press your finger to the sensor while you sleep. If you use face recognition on some phones, they could hold the phone in front of your face. A PIN is the safest option if this concerns you."
  - question: "How do I change my PIN later?"
    answer: "Go to Settings, then Security or Face ID and Passcode (iPhone), and choose Change PIN or Change Passcode. You will need to enter your current PIN first, then set a new one."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to set up a screen lock on your phone to protect your personal information. A screen lock means that when your phone screen turns off, no one can use your phone without entering a PIN, drawing a pattern, or using their fingerprint. This keeps your photos, messages, bank apps, and personal data safe if your phone is lost or stolen.

## What you need

- An iPhone or Android phone
- A few minutes

## The steps

### Step 1: Open your phone's security settings

**On iPhone:** Go to **Settings** and tap **Face ID & Passcode** (on newer iPhones) or **Touch ID & Passcode** (on older iPhones with a home button).

**On Android:** Go to **Settings** and tap **Security** (or **Lock Screen**, or **Security & Privacy**, depending on your phone brand). Then tap **Screen Lock**.

### Step 2: Choose your lock type

You will see several options for locking your phone:

- **PIN** -- a number code, usually 4 or 6 digits. This is the simplest and most common option.
- **Password** -- a longer code using letters and numbers. More secure but harder to type each time.
- **Pattern** -- draw a shape connecting dots on the screen (Android only).
- **Fingerprint** -- use your finger to unlock (available on most modern phones).
- **Face recognition** -- use your face to unlock (iPhone Face ID and some Android phones).

For most people, a **6-digit PIN** combined with **fingerprint** is the best balance of security and convenience.

### Step 3: Set up a PIN

Choose **PIN** and type a number that is easy for you to remember but hard for others to guess. Avoid obvious numbers like 123456, your birth year, or 000000. Type the PIN, then type it again to confirm. **Write this PIN down** on a piece of paper and keep it in a safe place at home.

### Step 4: Set up fingerprint unlock (optional but recommended)

Setting up your fingerprint means you can unlock your phone by touching the fingerprint sensor instead of typing your PIN every time.

**On iPhone:** Go to **Settings** > **Touch ID & Passcode**. Tap **Add a Fingerprint**. Place your finger on the home button (or the side button on newer models) and lift it repeatedly. The phone will capture your fingerprint. Follow the on-screen instructions until it is complete.

**On Android:** Go to **Settings** > **Security** > **Fingerprint** (or **Biometrics**). Tap **Add Fingerprint** and follow the instructions. You will need to place your finger on the sensor multiple times at different angles.

### Step 5: Set how quickly the screen locks

You can choose how long your phone waits before locking after the screen turns off.

**On iPhone:** Go to **Settings** > **Display & Brightness** > **Auto-Lock**. Choose a time like **1 minute** or **2 minutes**. Then in **Face ID & Passcode**, make sure **Require Passcode** is set to **Immediately**.

**On Android:** Go to **Settings** > **Security** > **Screen Lock** settings. Look for **Lock after screen timeout** and choose **Immediately** or **5 seconds** for the best security.

### Step 6: Test your lock screen

Press the **power button** on the side of your phone to turn off the screen. Wait a few seconds, then press it again to wake the phone. You should now see a lock screen asking for your PIN, fingerprint, or face. Enter your PIN or use your fingerprint to unlock. If it works, your phone is now protected.

## Tips

- Choose a PIN you can remember easily but that is not obvious to others. A good method is to use a meaningful date that only you know, like the date you moved into your home.
- Register the finger you use most often (usually your right thumb or index finger) for fingerprint unlock.
- If your phone supports it, register two fingerprints in case one finger is wet or has a plaster on it.
- Never share your PIN with strangers. Only share it with a trusted family member in case of emergency.
