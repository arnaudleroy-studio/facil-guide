  - question: "Is it safe to buy things on my phone?"
    answer: "Yes, shopping on your phone is safe when you use official apps or trusted websites. Look for the padlock icon in your browser's address bar, which means the connection is encrypted."
  - question: "How do I know if a website is real or fake?"
    answer: "Check that the web address starts with https and has a padlock icon. Look for spelling mistakes on the page, unusually low prices, and whether the website has contact information and a return policy. If something feels wrong, do not buy from that site."
  - question: "Should I save my credit card on my phone?"
    answer: "Saving your card in your phone's secure wallet (Apple Pay or Google Pay) is generally safe because it uses encryption. Avoid saving your card directly on shopping websites unless you trust them completely."
  - question: "What if I receive the wrong item or nothing at all?"
    answer: "Contact the seller first through the app or website. If they do not help, contact your bank to dispute the charge. Most banks can reverse payments for items you never received."
  - question: "Can I get a refund for online purchases?"
    answer: "Most online stores have a return policy that allows refunds within 14 to 30 days. Check the store's return policy before buying. Keep your order confirmation email as proof of purchase."

## What you will learn

You will learn how to find products online, check if a website or app is trustworthy, make a purchase safely, and protect your personal and payment information while shopping on your phone.

## What you need

- A smartphone (iPhone or Android)
- A Wi-Fi connection or mobile data
- A debit or credit card for payment
- An email address to receive order confirmations

### Step 1: Use trusted apps or websites

Open the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Google Play Store** (Android) and download the official app of the store you want to buy from, such as Amazon, Zara, or your local supermarket. Using the official app is safer than visiting a website because it is harder for scammers to create fake apps. If you use a browser instead, type the website address yourself rather than clicking a link from an email or message.

### Step 2: Check that the website is secure

If you are shopping in your browser, look at the top of the screen where the web address appears. You should see a **padlock icon** next to the address, and the address should start with **https**. The "s" stands for secure. If there is no padlock or the address starts with just "http," do not enter your payment details on that site.

### Step 3: Create an account or sign in

Most online stores ask you to create an account before buying. Tap **Sign Up** or **Create Account** and enter your name, email address, and a strong password. Use a different password than the one you use for your email. If you already have an account, tap **Sign In** and enter your email and password.

### Step 4: Find and select your product

Use the **search bar** at the top of the app or website to type what you are looking for. Browse the results and tap on a product to see its full description, price, and customer reviews. Read at least a few reviews from other buyers to check if the product is good quality. Pay attention to the total price, including shipping costs.

### Step 5: Add the product to your cart and review

Tap **Add to Cart** or **Add to Basket**. When you are ready to buy, tap the **cart icon** (usually in the top right corner) to review your order. Check that the product, size, colour, and quantity are correct. This is also where you can see the full price including any delivery charges.

### Step 6: Enter your delivery and payment details

Tap **Checkout** or **Proceed to Payment**. Enter your delivery address carefully, including your full name and phone number. For payment, you can type your card number directly or use **Apple Pay** or **Google Pay** for a faster and more secure option. These payment methods hide your real card number from the store.

### Step 7: Confirm your order and save the receipt

Review everything one last time, then tap **Place Order** or **Confirm Purchase**. You will see a confirmation screen with your order number. The store will also send a confirmation email. Save this email or take a screenshot by pressing the side button and volume up button at the same time. This is your proof of purchase if anything goes wrong.

## Tips

- Never buy from a link in an unexpected email or text message. Go to the store's app or website directly.
- Compare prices on different websites before buying to make sure you are getting a fair deal.
- Be cautious of prices that seem too good to be true. Very cheap products on unknown websites are often scams.
- Check the return policy before buying so you know your options if the product is not what you expected.
