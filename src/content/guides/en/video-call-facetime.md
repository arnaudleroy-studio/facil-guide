## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to make a video call using FaceTime on your iPhone. FaceTime lets you see the person you are talking to on your screen while they see you. It is a great way to stay in touch with family and friends.

## What you need

- An iPhone with an internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data)
- The person you want to call must also have an Apple device (iPhone, iPad, or Mac) or a FaceTime link

## The steps

### Step 1: Open the FaceTime app

Find and tap the **FaceTime** app on your home screen. It has a green icon with a white video camera. If you cannot find it, swipe down on your home screen and type **"FaceTime"** in the search bar.

### Step 2: Tap New FaceTime

At the top of the screen, tap the **"New FaceTime"** button. A new screen will appear where you can choose who to call.

### Step 3: Type the name or number of the person

In the **"To:"** field at the top, type the name of the person you want to call (if they are in your contacts) or type their phone number or email address. Tap their name when it appears in the suggestions below.

### Step 4: Start the video call

Tap the green **"FaceTime"** button to start the video call. Your iPhone will ring the other person. Wait for them to answer.

### Step 5: Talk and see each other

Once the other person answers, you will see their face on your screen and they will see yours. The large image shows the other person, and a small image in the corner shows what your camera is sending.

- To **switch cameras** (front to back), tap the camera flip button (two arrows forming a circle)
- To **mute your microphone**, tap the microphone button
- To **turn off your camera** temporarily, tap the camera button

### Step 6: End the call

When you are finished talking, tap the red **End** button (a red circle with a phone icon) to hang up.

## Helpful tips

- **Use Wi-Fi when possible**: Video calls use more data than regular calls. Connect to Wi-Fi to avoid using your mobile data.
- **Good lighting**: Sit facing a window or light source so the other person can see you clearly.
- **Hold your phone steady**: Rest your phone against something or hold it at eye level for a comfortable conversation.
- **FaceTime Audio**: If you want to call without video, tap the phone icon instead of the video icon when starting the call.
