  - question: "What is spam email?"
    answer: "Spam emails are unwanted messages sent in bulk. They often try to sell you something, trick you into clicking a dangerous link, or steal your personal information. Most email apps filter out spam automatically, but some still get through."
  - question: "Is it safe to open a spam email?"
    answer: "Opening a spam email is usually harmless. The danger comes from clicking links inside the email or downloading attachments. Never click a link or open a file from an email you do not trust."
  - question: "Why do I keep getting spam even after blocking?"
    answer: "Spammers change their email addresses frequently to avoid blocks. Keep reporting spam as it comes in. Over time, your email app learns to filter similar messages automatically."
  - question: "Will blocking someone delete their old emails?"
    answer: "No, blocking a sender only stops future emails from them. Their old emails stay in your inbox unless you delete them manually."
  - question: "Should I unsubscribe from spam emails?"
    answer: "Only unsubscribe from emails sent by companies you recognize and trust. For suspicious emails, do not click the unsubscribe link -- it could confirm to the spammer that your address is active. Instead, report it as spam."

## What you will learn

You will learn how to identify spam emails, block unwanted senders, report spam to your email provider, and unsubscribe from mailing lists safely. These steps work in Gmail, Yahoo Mail, and Outlook on your phone.

## What you need

- A smartphone (iPhone or Android)
- An email app (Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Outlook, or Apple Mail)

### Step 1: Identify the spam email

Open your email app and look at your inbox. Spam emails often have urgent subject lines like "You won a prize!" or "Your account has been suspended." They may come from email addresses that look strange or contain random numbers. If you do not recognize the sender and the message seems suspicious, it is probably spam.

### Step 2: Report spam in Gmail

Open the spam email. Tap the **three dots** in the top-right corner of the screen. Tap **Report spam**. Gmail will move the email to your Spam folder and learn to filter similar messages in the future. You can also swipe left on the email in your inbox and tap the **Report spam** icon without opening it.

### Step 3: Report spam in Outlook

Open the spam email. Tap the **three dots** in the top-right corner. Tap **Report junk** or **Move to Junk**. Outlook will move the email to your Junk folder and improve its filtering for future messages. On some versions, you can also tap **Block Sender** to prevent future emails from that address.

### Step 4: Report spam in Yahoo Mail

Open the spam email. Tap the **three dots** or the **More** button. Tap **Report spam**. Yahoo will move the email to your Spam folder. Over time, Yahoo learns from your reports and filters similar emails automatically.

### Step 5: Block a specific sender

If the same sender keeps bothering you, block them. In Gmail, open an email from the sender, tap the **three dots**, and tap **Block [sender name]**. In Outlook, tap the three dots and choose **Block Sender**. In Yahoo, tap the three dots and choose **Block Sender**. Blocked senders can no longer reach your inbox.

### Step 6: Unsubscribe from mailing lists safely

If you receive newsletters or promotions from companies you recognize, scroll to the bottom of the email. Look for a small **Unsubscribe** link. Tap it and follow the instructions. Gmail often shows an **Unsubscribe** button at the top of the email, making it even easier. Only do this for emails from companies you trust.

### Step 7: Check your spam folder regularly

Your email app catches many spam messages automatically and puts them in the Spam or Junk folder. Check this folder once a week to make sure no real emails were accidentally marked as spam. If you find a good email there, open it and tap **Not spam** or **Move to Inbox** to rescue it.

## Tips

- Never reply to spam emails, even to say "stop" -- this confirms your email address is active
- Never click links in emails from unknown senders
- Do not share your email address on public websites or social media
- Use a separate email address for online shopping and signups to keep your main inbox cleaner
- Most spam filters improve over time as you report more spam
