  - question: "Will sharing photos use my mobile data?"
    answer: "Yes, if you are not connected to Wi-Fi. Sending photos uses a small amount of data. If you are on Wi-Fi, it does not use your mobile data at all."
  - question: "Can I share many photos at once?"
    answer: "Yes. Most apps let you select multiple photos and share them all at the same time. In your photo gallery, tap and hold one photo, then tap others to select more."
  - question: "Will the photo quality be reduced when I share it?"
    answer: "On WhatsApp, photos are slightly compressed to save data. If you want full quality, use email, AirDrop, or a shared album in Google Photos or iCloud."
  - question: "Can my family member save the photos I send them?"
    answer: "Yes. They can tap and hold the photo in WhatsApp or open the email attachment and save it to their phone."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn three easy ways to share photos with your family: through WhatsApp, by email, and using a shared photo album. You can pick the method that works best for you and your family.

## What you need

- A phone with photos you want to share
- WhatsApp, an email app, or Google Photos / iCloud Photos installed
- Your family member's phone number or email address

## Steps

### Step 1: Open your photo gallery

On your iPhone, open the **Photos** app. On an Android phone, open the **Gallery** or **Google Photos** app. Find the photo you want to share and tap on it to open it in full screen.

### Step 2: Tap the share button

With the photo open, look for the **share** button. On iPhone, it is a square with an upward arrow at the bottom-left. On Android, it is three connected dots or the word **Share**. Tap it. A list of sharing options will appear.

### Step 3: Share via WhatsApp

In the sharing options, tap **WhatsApp**. Select the family member you want to send the photo to from your contact list. You can add a short message if you like. Then tap the **send** button (green arrow). The photo will be sent instantly.

### Step 4: Share by email

If you prefer email, tap **Mail** or **Gmail** in the sharing options. A new email will open with the photo attached. Type your family member's email address in the **To** field. Add a subject like "Photos from today." Tap **Send**.

### Step 5: Select multiple photos to share

To share more than one photo at a time, go back to your gallery. Tap **Select** at the top-right corner. Then tap each photo you want to share. A checkmark will appear on selected photos. When you have selected all the photos you want, tap the **share** button and choose your preferred method.

### Step 6: Create a shared album for ongoing sharing

For regular photo sharing, create a shared album. On iPhone, open **Photos**, go to **Albums**, tap **+** at the top-left, and select **New Shared Album**. Name it and add your family member. On Android, open **Google Photos**, tap **Sharing**, then **Create shared album**. Add family members by email address.

### Step 7: Add photos to your shared album

Open the shared album you created. Tap the **+** button to add photos from your gallery. Select the photos and tap **Add**. Your family members will see the new photos automatically. They can also add their own photos to the same album.

## Tips

- If your family member is nearby and uses an iPhone, you can use **AirDrop** to send photos instantly without using the internet. Tap the share button and select their name under AirDrop.
- Ask your family members to turn on notifications for the shared album so they know when new photos are added.
- If you take a lot of photos, share albums are better than WhatsApp because the photos stay organized in one place and are not lost in the chat history.
