  - question: "Is it safe to save my passwords on my phone?"
    answer: "Yes. The built-in password managers on iPhone (Passwords app) and Android (Google Password Manager) encrypt your passwords. This means they are stored in a secure, scrambled format that only you can access with your phone's lock screen PIN, fingerprint, or face."
  - question: "What happens if I lose my phone?"
    answer: "Your saved passwords are protected by your phone's lock screen. Nobody can see them without your PIN, fingerprint, or face. Your passwords are also backed up to your iCloud or Google account, so you can access them on a new phone by signing in with the same account."
  - question: "Do I need to download a special app?"
    answer: "No. Both iPhone and Android have built-in password managers that work automatically. You do not need to install anything extra. There are also third-party apps like 1Password or Bitwarden if you want more features, but the built-in option is enough for most people."
  - question: "Can the phone create strong passwords for me?"
    answer: "Yes. When you sign up for a new website or app, your phone will suggest a strong password made of random letters, numbers, and symbols. You do not need to remember it because the phone saves it for you."
  - question: "Will my passwords work on my computer too?"
    answer: "Yes. If you use iCloud on a Mac or the Safari browser on Windows, your iPhone passwords sync to your computer. If you use Google Chrome on any computer and sign in with your Google account, your Android passwords sync there too."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to use the password manager that is already built into your iPhone or Android phone. A password manager saves all your passwords in one safe place so you do not have to remember each one. When you visit a website or open an app, the phone fills in your password for you automatically.

## What you need

- An iPhone or Android phone
- Your phone's lock screen set up with a PIN, fingerprint, or face recognition
- An internet connection

### Step 1: Make sure your lock screen is set up

Your phone's password manager only works if your phone has a lock screen. This is the PIN, fingerprint, or face recognition you use to unlock your phone. If you have not set this up yet, go to **Settings**, then **Face ID and Passcode** (on iPhone) or **Settings**, then **Security** (on Android). Follow the instructions to create a PIN or set up your fingerprint.

### Step 2: Turn on the password manager

On most phones, the password manager is already turned on. To check:

- **On iPhone:** Open **Settings**, scroll down and tap **Passwords**. You will be asked to unlock with Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode. If you see a list of saved passwords, it is already working.
- **On Android:** Open **Settings**, tap **Google**, then tap **Manage your Google Account**. Go to the **Security** tab and look for **Password Manager**. You can also open **Chrome**, tap the three dots in the top right, and tap **Password Manager**.

### Step 3: Save a password for the first time

The next time you log into a website or app, your phone will offer to save the password. After you type your email and password and tap **Sign In**, a small message will appear asking if you want to save the password. Tap **Save Password** or **Save**. The phone will remember it for next time.

### Step 4: Let the phone fill in your password automatically

When you return to a website or app where you saved a password, tap the username or email field. Your phone will show a suggestion with your saved login at the top of the keyboard or in a pop-up. Tap it, and the phone will fill in both your email and password automatically. You may need to confirm with your fingerprint or face.

### Step 5: Find and view your saved passwords

If you need to see a password you saved:

- **On iPhone:** Open **Settings**, tap **Passwords**, and unlock with Face ID or your passcode. You will see a list of all your saved accounts. Tap any entry to see the username and password.
- **On Android:** Open **Settings**, tap **Google**, then **Password Manager**. Or open **Chrome**, tap the three dots, and tap **Password Manager**. Tap any entry to see the details.

### Step 6: Let the phone suggest a strong password

When you create a new account on a website or app, tap the password field. Your phone will suggest a strong password made of random characters. On iPhone, you will see **Use Strong Password** appear above the keyboard. On Android, Chrome will show **Suggest strong password**. Tap it to use the suggestion. The phone will save it automatically.

### Step 7: Check for weak or reused passwords

Your phone can tell you if any of your passwords are weak, reused, or appeared in a data leak.

- **On iPhone:** Go to **Settings**, then **Passwords**, then tap **Security Recommendations** at the top. It will list any passwords that need attention.
- **On Android:** Open **Password Manager** (through Settings or Chrome) and look for **Password Checkup**. It will scan your saved passwords and warn you about any problems.

If you see a warning, tap the entry and tap **Change Password** to visit the website and update it.

## Tips

- Use a different password for every account. The password manager remembers them all, so you do not have to.
- Never share your phone's lock screen PIN with anyone. It protects all your saved passwords.
- If your phone suggests a strong password, always accept it. Random passwords are much safer than passwords you make up yourself.
- Check the security recommendations once a month to stay safe.
