faq:
  - question: "Are WhatsApp calls really free?"
    answer: "Yes, WhatsApp calls use your internet connection instead of your phone plan's minutes. You do not pay per call. However, the call uses a small amount of data, so make sure you are connected to Wi-Fi or have mobile data included in your plan."
  - question: "Can I call someone in another country?"
    answer: "Yes, you can call anyone in the world for free as long as both of you have WhatsApp and an internet connection. There are no international charges because the call goes through the internet, not the phone network."
  - question: "Why is the call quality poor?"
    answer: "Call quality depends on your internet connection. If you are on a slow or weak Wi-Fi signal, the sound may break up. Try moving closer to your Wi-Fi router or switch to mobile data. A strong connection gives you clear sound."
  - question: "Can I call someone who does not have WhatsApp?"
    answer: "No, both people need WhatsApp installed on their phones to make a WhatsApp call. If the other person does not have WhatsApp, you will need to use a regular phone call."
  - question: "Can I make a group call?"
    answer: "Yes, you can call up to 32 people at the same time on WhatsApp. During a call, tap the Add Participant button to invite more people to join the conversation."

## What you will learn

You will learn how to make free voice calls using WhatsApp. You will learn how to call a single contact, how to call from a chat conversation, and how to manage your call settings for the best experience.

## What you need

- A smartphone (iPhone or Android) with WhatsApp installed
- A Wi-Fi connection or mobile data
- The person you want to call must also have WhatsApp

### Step 1: Open WhatsApp

Tap the **WhatsApp** icon on your home screen to open the app. You will see your list of recent chats.

### Step 2: Find the person you want to call

There are two ways to start a call. The easiest way is to open your chat with the person. Scroll through your chats and tap on the conversation with the person you want to call. If you have never chatted with them, tap the **New Chat** button (pencil icon) and select their name from your contacts.

### Step 3: Start the voice call

In the chat screen, look at the top-right corner. You will see a **phone icon** (not the video camera icon). Tap the **phone icon** to start a voice call. Your phone will ring the other person. Wait for them to answer.

### Step 4: Talk and manage the call

Once the person answers, you can talk normally like a regular phone call. You will see a timer showing how long you have been on the call. During the call, you have several buttons on screen. Tap the **microphone** icon to mute yourself if you need a moment of silence. Tap the **speaker** icon to switch to speakerphone so others in the room can hear.

### Step 5: Add another person to the call

If you want to bring someone else into the conversation, tap the **Add Participant** button (a person icon with a plus sign) during the call. Select a contact from your list and WhatsApp will call them. When they answer, all of you will be connected together in a group call.

### Step 6: End the call

When you are finished talking, tap the **red phone button** at the bottom of the screen to hang up. After the call ends, you will see the call duration in your chat. The call will also appear in the **Calls** tab at the bottom of WhatsApp, where you can see your complete call history.

## Tips

- Use Wi-Fi whenever possible for the best call quality and to avoid using mobile data
- Use earphones or headphones for a more private conversation and clearer sound
- If the call does not connect, make sure the other person has WhatsApp installed and an internet connection
- You can call someone directly from the **Calls** tab by tapping the phone icon next to their name
- WhatsApp calls work even when you are traveling abroad, saving you expensive international calling fees
