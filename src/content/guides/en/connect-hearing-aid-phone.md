  - question: "Does my hearing aid work with my phone?"
    answer: "Most modern hearing aids with Bluetooth work with iPhones and Android phones. iPhones support Made for iPhone (MFi) hearing aids directly. Android phones support ASHA (Audio Streaming for Hearing Aids) compatible devices. Check with your hearing aid provider if you are not sure."
  - question: "Do I need a special app?"
    answer: "Many hearing aid brands have a free companion app (such as Phonak, Oticon, ReSound, or Starkey apps) that gives you extra controls. However, the basic connection works without any app. The app is optional and adds features like adjusting volume or switching programs."
  - question: "Why does my hearing aid keep disconnecting?"
    answer: "Make sure your hearing aid batteries are charged. Stay within about 3 meters (10 feet) of your phone. Check that Bluetooth is still turned on. If it keeps disconnecting, try removing the hearing aid from your Bluetooth list and pairing it again from the beginning."
  - question: "Can I connect two hearing aids at the same time?"
    answer: "Yes. If you wear hearing aids in both ears, your phone will usually detect and connect to both during the pairing process. They will appear as a pair in your settings."
  - question: "Will I hear phone calls in my hearing aid?"
    answer: "Yes. Once connected, phone calls will play directly into your hearing aid. You will hear the other person clearly without holding the phone to your ear. You can speak normally and the phone's microphone will pick up your voice."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to connect a Bluetooth hearing aid to your iPhone or Android phone. Once connected, you will hear phone calls, video calls, music, and other sounds directly in your hearing aid. This makes it much easier to hear clearly without turning up the phone volume.

## What you need

- An iPhone or Android phone with Bluetooth
- A Bluetooth-compatible hearing aid (check the box or manual for the Bluetooth symbol)
- Your hearing aid fully charged or with fresh batteries

### Step 1: Charge your hearing aid and phone

Before you start, make sure your hearing aid has a full battery. If your hearing aid uses rechargeable batteries, place it in its charging case until the light shows it is fully charged. If it uses disposable batteries, put in a fresh battery. Also make sure your phone has at least 50% battery.

### Step 2: Turn on Bluetooth on your phone

You need Bluetooth turned on to connect your hearing aid.

- **On iPhone:** Open **Settings**, then tap **Bluetooth**. Make sure the switch at the top is green (on).
- **On Android:** Open **Settings**, then tap **Connected devices** or **Bluetooth**. Make sure Bluetooth is turned on.

### Step 3: Put your hearing aid in pairing mode

To connect for the first time, your hearing aid must be in pairing mode. This tells the hearing aid to look for your phone.

- **For rechargeable hearing aids:** Open the charging case, take out the hearing aid, and close the case. Most hearing aids enter pairing mode automatically for a few minutes after you take them out.
- **For battery-powered hearing aids:** Open the battery door, wait 5 seconds, then close it. The hearing aid will restart and enter pairing mode.
- **If your hearing aid has a button:** Press and hold the button for 3 to 5 seconds until you hear a beep or see a flashing light.

If you are not sure how to enter pairing mode, check the instruction booklet that came with your hearing aid or ask your audiologist.

### Step 4: Connect on iPhone

If you use an iPhone with a Made for iPhone (MFi) hearing aid:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Tap **Accessibility**
3. Tap **Hearing Devices**
4. Wait for your hearing aid name to appear under **MFi Hearing Devices**
5. Tap the name of your hearing aid
6. Tap **Pair** when asked

You will hear a series of beeps in your hearing aid to confirm the connection. If you wear two hearing aids, you will be asked to pair each one.

### Step 5: Connect on Android

If you use an Android phone:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Tap **Connected devices**
3. Tap **Pair new device**
4. Wait for your hearing aid name to appear in the list
5. Tap the name of your hearing aid
6. Tap **Pair** when asked

Some Android phones also have a dedicated hearing aid section. Go to **Settings**, then **Accessibility**, then **Hearing aids** to find it.

### Step 6: Test the connection

Once paired, make a test call to someone or play a short video on your phone. You should hear the sound directly in your hearing aid. If the sound is too quiet or too loud, you can adjust the volume using the volume buttons on the side of your phone. The volume will change in your hearing aid.

### Step 7: Set up your hearing aid app (optional)

Most hearing aid brands offer a free app that gives you more control. Search for your hearing aid brand in the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Google Play Store** (Android). For example:

- Phonak: **myPhonak**
- Oticon: **Oticon Companion**
- ReSound: **ReSound Smart 3D**
- Starkey: **My Starkey**

Download the app, open it, and follow the setup steps. The app lets you adjust volume, switch between listening programs, and check battery level.

## Tips

- Keep your phone within about 3 meters (10 feet) of your hearing aid for the best connection.
- If the hearing aid does not appear in the list, restart both the hearing aid and your phone, then try again.
- When you answer a phone call, the audio will automatically switch to your hearing aid. You do not need to change any setting.
- If you get a new phone, you will need to pair your hearing aid again using the same steps.
