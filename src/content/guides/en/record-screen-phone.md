  - question: "Does screen recording capture sound?"
    answer: "Yes. Screen recording captures sounds from the app you are using. On iPhone, you can also turn on the microphone to record your voice at the same time by long-pressing the screen recording button in Control Center."
  - question: "Where do screen recordings get saved?"
    answer: "Screen recordings are saved in your Photos app (iPhone) or Gallery app (Android), just like regular videos."
  - question: "Is there a time limit for screen recording?"
    answer: "There is no fixed time limit, but longer recordings take up more storage space. A 10-minute recording can use several hundred megabytes. Make sure you have enough free space before recording."
  - question: "Can I record a phone call or video call?"
    answer: "Screen recording can capture video calls on some apps. However, some apps like FaceTime may mute the audio during recording for privacy reasons. Phone calls (regular calls) are usually not recorded."
  - question: "Why is there no sound in my recording?"
    answer: "Make sure the volume on your phone is turned up. On iPhone, check that the microphone is turned on by long-pressing the screen recording button in Control Center. On Android, check the screen recorder settings before starting."

## What you will learn

You will learn how to record a video of everything happening on your phone screen. This is useful when you want to show someone how to do something, save a tutorial, or record a problem to show technical support.

## What you need

- An iPhone running iOS 14 or later, or an Android phone running Android 11 or later
- Enough free storage space for the video

### Step 1: Find the screen recording feature (iPhone)

Open **Settings**, then tap **Control Center**. Look for **Screen Recording** in the list. If it is not already added, tap the **green plus icon** next to it. This adds the screen recording button to your Control Center, which you access by swiping down from the top-right corner of your screen.

### Step 2: Find the screen recording feature (Android)

Swipe down from the top of your screen with two fingers to open the **Quick Settings** panel. Look for a button labeled **Screen Record** or **Screen Recorder**. If you do not see it, tap the **pencil icon** to edit your Quick Settings and add it.

### Step 3: Start recording

On iPhone, swipe down from the top-right corner to open **Control Center**. Tap the **screen recording button** (a circle inside another circle). A 3-second countdown will appear, then recording begins. On Android, tap the **Screen Record** button in Quick Settings. Choose whether to record audio from your microphone, your device, or both. Tap **Start**.

### Step 4: Use your phone normally while recording

Everything you do on your screen is now being recorded. Open the app or page you want to show. Navigate, type, tap -- all of it will appear in the video. A red indicator will appear at the top of your screen to remind you that recording is active.

### Step 5: Stop recording

On iPhone, tap the **red status bar** at the top of the screen and then tap **Stop**. You can also open Control Center and tap the recording button again. On Android, swipe down from the top and tap **Stop** on the screen recorder notification.

### Step 6: Find and share your recording

Open the **Photos** app (iPhone) or **Gallery** app (Android). Your recording will be the most recent video. Tap on it to watch it. To share it, tap the **share icon** and choose how you want to send it -- for example, by WhatsApp, email, or text message.

## Tips

- Close notifications you do not want to appear in your recording before you start
- Practice a short recording first to make sure audio and video work correctly
- Keep recordings short when possible -- they take up a lot of storage space
- If you want to explain something while recording, turn on the microphone so your voice is captured
- Trim the beginning and end of the video in the Photos app to remove the parts where you start and stop recording
