  - question: "Is it safe to check my bank account on my phone?"
    answer: "Yes, your bank's official app uses strong encryption to protect your data. Always download the app from the App Store or Google Play Store and never from a link in an email or text message."
  - question: "What if I forget my banking app password?"
    answer: "Tap the Forgot Password or Reset Password link on the login screen. Your bank will send you a code by text message or email to create a new password. You can also call your bank's customer service for help."
  - question: "Can someone steal my money if I lose my phone?"
    answer: "If your phone is locked with a PIN, fingerprint, or face recognition, it is very difficult for someone to access your banking app. Contact your bank immediately if you lose your phone so they can lock your account."
  - question: "Do I need internet to use my banking app?"
    answer: "Yes, you need a Wi-Fi connection or mobile data to check your balance and transactions. The app needs to connect to your bank's servers to show current information."
  - question: "Will the app show all my accounts?"
    answer: "Most banking apps show all accounts you have with that bank, including savings accounts, checking accounts, and credit cards. You can usually switch between them on the main screen."

## What you will learn

You will learn how to open your banking app, check your account balance, view your recent transactions, and understand the basic features available to you. You will also learn how to keep your banking app secure.

## What you need

- A smartphone (iPhone or Android)
- Your bank's mobile app installed
- Your bank account login details (username and password)
- A Wi-Fi connection or mobile data

### Step 1: Open your banking app

Find your bank's app on your phone's home screen and tap it. The icon usually shows your bank's logo. If you do not have the app yet, open the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Google Play Store** (Android), search for your bank's name, and tap **Install**. Only download the official app from your bank.

### Step 2: Log in to your account

Enter your username and password on the login screen. Some banks use your account number or email address as your username. If you have set up fingerprint or face recognition, you can use that instead. Tap **Log In** or **Sign In** to continue.

### Step 3: View your account balance

After logging in, your main account balance appears on the home screen. This shows how much money is currently in your account. If you have more than one account, you will see each account listed with its own balance. Tap on any account to see more details.

### Step 4: Check your recent transactions

Tap on your account or look for a section called **Transactions**, **Activity**, or **Recent Movements**. You will see a list of your recent payments, deposits, and withdrawals. Each entry shows the date, the amount, and who received or sent the money. Scroll down to see older transactions.

### Step 5: Search for a specific transaction

If you are looking for a particular payment, tap the **Search** icon (usually a magnifying glass) in the transactions screen. Type the name of a shop or person, or enter an amount. The app will filter the list to show only matching transactions. This is useful when you want to check if a specific bill was paid.

### Step 6: Set up notifications

Go to your app's **Settings** (usually a gear icon). Look for **Notifications** or **Alerts**. Turn on notifications for incoming payments, outgoing payments, and low balance warnings. This way, your phone will alert you every time money enters or leaves your account, helping you stay aware of your finances.

### Step 7: Log out when finished

When you are done checking your account, tap the **Menu** icon (three lines or your profile picture) and look for **Log Out** or **Sign Out**. Tap it to securely close your session. This is especially important if other people have access to your phone.

## Tips

- Check your balance regularly, at least once a week, to catch any unfamiliar charges early
- Never share your banking login details with anyone, even family members -- each person should have their own access
- If you see a transaction you do not recognize, contact your bank immediately
- Use a strong password that is different from your other accounts
- Enable fingerprint or face recognition for faster and safer logins
- Avoid checking your bank account on public Wi-Fi networks -- use your mobile data instead
