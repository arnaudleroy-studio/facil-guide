## What you will learn

You will learn how to enable the Emergency SOS feature on your iPhone or Android phone, set up emergency contacts, test that everything works, and understand how to activate it in a real emergency.

## What you need

- A smartphone (iPhone or Android)
- The phone numbers of people you want as emergency contacts (family members or close friends)

### Step 1: Open your phone settings

On iPhone, tap **Settings** on your home screen. On Android, swipe down from the top of the screen and tap the **gear icon**, or find **Settings** in your app list. This is where you control all your phone's features, including emergency options.

### Step 2: Find the Emergency SOS settings

On iPhone, scroll down in Settings and tap **Emergency SOS**. On Android, tap **Safety and Emergency** or **Safety** (the exact name depends on your phone brand). On Samsung phones, look for **Safety and Emergency** under Settings. On Google Pixel phones, tap **Safety** then **Emergency SOS**.

### Step 3: Turn on Emergency SOS

On iPhone, make sure **Call with Hold and Release** is turned on. This lets you hold the side button and a volume button together to start an emergency call. On Android, turn on the **Emergency SOS** toggle. Some Android phones let you press the power button quickly five times to trigger the call.

### Step 4: Set up your emergency contacts

On iPhone, tap **Set Up Emergency Contacts in Health** or open the **Health** app, tap your profile picture, then tap **Medical ID**. Tap **Edit** and scroll to **Emergency Contacts**. Tap **Add Emergency Contact** and choose someone from your contacts list.

On Android, go back to **Safety and Emergency** and tap **Emergency Contacts**. Tap **Add Contact** and select the people you want to notify during an emergency.

### Step 5: Enable automatic location sharing

On iPhone, go back to **Settings**, then **Emergency SOS**, and turn on **Share in Emergency Call**. Your phone will automatically send your location to your emergency contacts after an SOS call ends.

On Android, in **Safety and Emergency**, look for **Emergency Location Service** and make sure it is turned on. This shares your location with emergency services when you call them.

### Step 6: Add your medical information

On iPhone, open the **Health** app, tap your profile picture, and tap **Medical ID**. Tap **Edit** and fill in important details like allergies, medications, blood type, and medical conditions. Make sure **Show When Locked** is turned on so paramedics can see this information without unlocking your phone.

On Android, go to **Safety and Emergency** and tap **Medical Information**. Enter your details. This information can be viewed from the lock screen in an emergency.

### Step 7: Test that it works (without calling)

On iPhone, go to **Settings**, then **Emergency SOS**, and review your settings. You can see which buttons activate it. Do not actually trigger a call unless it is a real emergency. Instead, confirm that your emergency contacts are listed and location sharing is on.

On Android, open **Safety and Emergency** and verify your contacts and settings are correct. Some phones show a preview of what happens when you trigger Emergency SOS.

## Tips

- Tell your emergency contacts that you have added them so they know to expect a message from your phone if something happens.
- Practice finding the Emergency SOS setting so you remember where it is, but never trigger a real call for testing.
- Keep your emergency contacts up to date. If someone changes their phone number, update it in your settings.
- Consider adding your doctor's phone number in your medical information section.
