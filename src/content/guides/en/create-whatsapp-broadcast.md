  - question: "What is the difference between a broadcast and a group?"
    answer: "In a group, everyone sees each other's messages and replies. In a broadcast, each person receives your message privately, as if you sent it only to them. They cannot see who else received it."
  - question: "Will people know I sent a broadcast?"
    answer: "No, recipients see your message as a normal private message. They do not know it was sent to other people at the same time."
  - question: "Is there a limit on how many people I can add?"
    answer: "Yes, you can add up to 256 contacts to a single broadcast list. This is more than enough for most people."
  - question: "Do my contacts need to have my number saved?"
    answer: "Yes. For someone to receive your broadcast message, they must have your phone number saved in their contacts. If they do not have your number saved, they will not receive the message."
  - question: "Can I send photos and videos in a broadcast?"
    answer: "Yes, you can send text, photos, videos, documents, and voice messages through a broadcast list, just like in a regular chat."

## What you will learn

You will learn how to create a broadcast list on WhatsApp to send the same message to multiple contacts at once. Each person receives the message privately. This is useful for sending holiday greetings, family updates, or event invitations without creating a group.

## What you need

- A smartphone with WhatsApp installed
- The contacts you want to message must have your phone number saved in their phone

### Step 1: Open WhatsApp

Tap the **WhatsApp** icon on your home screen to open the app. You will see your list of recent chats.

### Step 2: Start a new broadcast

On iPhone, tap **Broadcast Lists** in the top-left corner of the Chats screen, then tap **New List**. On Android, tap the three dots in the top-right corner of the Chats screen, then tap **New broadcast**.

### Step 3: Select your contacts

You will see a list of all your contacts. Tap on each person you want to include in your broadcast. A green checkmark will appear next to each selected contact. When you have selected everyone, tap **Create** (iPhone) or the green checkmark button (Android).

### Step 4: Write and send your message

Your new broadcast list opens like a regular chat. Type your message in the text box at the bottom of the screen. You can also tap the camera icon to send a photo, or the paperclip icon to attach a document. When your message is ready, tap the **Send** button (the arrow icon).

### Step 5: Check who received your message

After sending, you will see your message in the broadcast chat. Tap and hold on the message, then tap **Info** (iPhone) or the **i** icon (Android). You will see a list showing who received the message and who has read it, indicated by blue checkmarks.

### Step 6: Send more messages later

Your broadcast list is saved. To send another message to the same group of people, go to your Chats screen and tap on the broadcast list. It appears like any other chat with a small broadcast icon. Type and send your new message.

## Tips

- Name your broadcast list so you remember who is in it, such as "Family" or "Book Club"
- If someone does not receive your message, ask them to save your phone number in their contacts
- You can edit a broadcast list later to add or remove contacts
- Use broadcasts for announcements and updates instead of creating groups where everyone can reply
- Replies to your broadcast come as private messages, so you can have individual conversations
