## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to use the Notes app on your phone to write things down quickly. You can use it for shopping lists, reminders, phone numbers, or anything else you want to remember. Your notes are saved automatically and synced to the cloud.

## What you need

- An iPhone with the **Notes** app (pre-installed) or an Android phone with **Google Keep** (pre-installed on most Android phones)
- Your Apple ID or Google account signed in on the phone

## Steps

### Step 1: Open the Notes app

On an iPhone, find the **Notes** app on your home screen. It has a yellow and white icon that looks like a notepad. On an Android phone, open the **Google Keep** app. It has a yellow icon with a white lightbulb. If you cannot find it, swipe down on your home screen and type "Notes" or "Keep" in the search bar.

### Step 2: Create a new note

Tap the **compose** button to create a new note. On iPhone, this is a small square icon with a pen in the bottom-right corner. On Google Keep, tap the **+** button in the bottom-right corner. A blank note will open.

### Step 3: Write your note

Tap anywhere on the blank note and start typing using your keyboard. Write whatever you need to remember. For example, type a shopping list or a reminder for a doctor appointment. The note saves automatically as you type.

### Step 4: Give your note a title

Tap at the very top of the note and type a short title. For example, "Shopping List" or "Doctor Appointment." A title makes it easier to find the note later when you have many notes.

### Step 5: Use a checklist for lists

If you are making a list, you can add checkboxes. On iPhone, tap the **checklist** icon (a circle with a checkmark) in the toolbar above the keyboard. On Google Keep, tap the **+** icon at the bottom and select **Checkboxes**. Now each line becomes an item you can check off.

### Step 6: Find a note you wrote before

Go back to the main notes screen by tapping the **back arrow** or **< Notes** at the top-left. You will see all your notes listed. Scroll through the list or use the **search bar** at the top to find a specific note by typing a word that is in it.

### Step 7: Delete a note you no longer need

To delete a note, open it and tap the **more options** button. On iPhone, tap the three dots **...** at the top-right and select **Delete**. On Google Keep, tap the three dots **...** at the bottom-right and select **Delete**. The note moves to a trash folder and is permanently deleted after 30 days.

## Tips

- Pin important notes to the top of your list so they are always easy to find. On iPhone, swipe right on a note and tap the **pin** icon. On Google Keep, tap the **pin** icon at the top of the note.
- Use different folders or labels to organize notes by topic. For example, create a folder called "Health" for medical notes and "Home" for household reminders.
- You can also dictate a note using your voice instead of typing. Tap the **microphone** icon on your keyboard and speak.
