## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to use WhatsApp Status, a feature that lets you share photos, videos, or text updates with your contacts. These updates disappear after 24 hours, similar to stories on other apps. It is a simple way to share a moment with family and friends without sending individual messages.

## What you need

- A phone with WhatsApp installed and set up
- A photo, video, or text you want to share (optional, you can create text statuses directly)

### Step 1: Open the Status screen

Open **WhatsApp** on your phone. On iPhone, tap the **Status** tab at the bottom of the screen. On Android, tap the **Status** tab at the top of the screen. You will see your own status area at the top and your contacts' recent statuses below.

### Step 2: Create a photo or video status

Tap **My Status** (or the **pencil icon** with a camera on Android, or the **camera icon** on iPhone). Your camera will open. Take a photo or tap the **gallery icon** in the corner to choose an existing photo from your phone. You can add text on top of the photo by tapping the **T** icon.

### Step 3: Create a text-only status

If you want to post a text message without a photo, tap the **pencil icon** (on Android) or the **text icon** (on iPhone, it looks like a pencil on a coloured background). Type your message. You can tap the **colour palette** icon to change the background colour.

### Step 4: Post your status

When your photo or text is ready, tap the **Send** button (the green arrow icon) in the bottom right corner. Your status is now live and visible to your contacts for the next 24 hours.

### Step 5: View other people's statuses

On the Status screen, you will see a list of contacts who have posted recent statuses. Tap on a contact's name to view their status. The status plays automatically. Tap the right side of the screen to skip to the next status, or tap the left side to go back.

### Step 6: Control who sees your status

Open WhatsApp and go to **Settings** (the gear icon on iPhone, or the three dots menu on Android). Tap **Privacy**, then tap **Status**. You can choose between **My contacts** (everyone), **My contacts except** (exclude certain people), or **Only share with** (pick specific contacts).

## Tips

- You can post multiple status updates at the same time and they will play one after another for viewers
- If you change your mind, you can delete a status before the 24 hours are up by going to My Status, tapping the three dots next to the update, and choosing **Delete**
- Status updates use your internet connection, not SMS, so they are free to post and view
- Posting a status does not send a notification to your contacts, they simply see it when they open the Status tab
