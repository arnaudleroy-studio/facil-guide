  - question: "Is sharing my location on WhatsApp safe?"
    answer: "Your location is only shared with the specific person or group you send it to. No one else can see it. You can stop sharing your live location at any time."
  - question: "Does the other person need WhatsApp to see my location?"
    answer: "Yes, both of you need WhatsApp. The location appears as a map inside the chat. They can tap on it to open it in their maps app for directions."
  - question: "What is the difference between current location and live location?"
    answer: "Current location sends a snapshot of where you are right now, one time. Live location continuously updates your position on the map for a period you choose (15 minutes, 1 hour, or 8 hours). Live location is useful when someone is coming to meet you."
  - question: "Does sharing my location use a lot of battery?"
    answer: "Sharing your current location once uses very little battery. Sharing live location uses more battery because your phone keeps updating your position. It is similar to using a maps app for navigation."
  - question: "Can I share my location without internet?"
    answer: "No, you need an internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data) to send your location on WhatsApp. However, your phone's GPS works without internet to determine your position."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to send your location to someone on WhatsApp. This is useful when you want to tell a family member exactly where you are, help someone find a meeting point, or let your family track your position during a journey. You can send a one-time snapshot of your current location or share your live location that updates in real time.

## What you need

- A phone with WhatsApp installed
- Location services turned on (GPS)
- An internet connection

## The steps

### Step 1: Open a WhatsApp conversation

Open **WhatsApp** and tap on the conversation with the person you want to share your location with. This can be a one-on-one chat or a group chat.

### Step 2: Tap the attachment button

Tap the **plus icon** (iPhone) or the **paperclip icon** (Android) next to the message box at the bottom of the screen. A menu of options will appear.

### Step 3: Choose Location

From the menu, tap **Location**. Your phone may ask for permission to access your location. Tap **Allow** or **Allow While Using App**. Wait a moment while your phone finds your current position on the map.

### Step 4: Send your current location

You will see a map showing your current position with a blue dot. To send a one-time snapshot of where you are right now, tap **Send Your Current Location**. A map image with your position will appear in the chat. The other person can tap on it to see your exact position and get directions.

### Step 5: Share your live location (optional)

If you want the other person to see your position updating in real time, tap **Share Live Location** instead. Choose how long you want to share: **15 minutes**, **1 hour**, or **8 hours**. You can add a comment like "On my way!" and tap **Send**. The other person will see your position moving on the map as you travel.

### Step 6: Stop sharing live location

If you chose to share your live location and want to stop before the time runs out, open the conversation and tap **Stop Sharing** on the live location message. Your position will no longer update. You can also go to **WhatsApp Settings** > **Privacy** > **Live Location** to stop all active shares at once.

## Tips

- Before sharing your location, make sure your phone's location services (GPS) are turned on. On iPhone, go to **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Location Services** and make sure it is on. On Android, swipe down from the top of the screen and tap the **Location** icon to turn it on.
- Live location is very useful when meeting someone in a crowded place like a shopping centre or train station.
- Only share your location with people you trust. Never share your live location with strangers.
- If the map shows your position in the wrong place, go outside or near a window. GPS works better with a clear view of the sky.
