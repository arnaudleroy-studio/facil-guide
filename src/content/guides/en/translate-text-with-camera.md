  - question: "Does camera translation work without internet?"
    answer: "Google Translate can work offline if you download the language packs in advance. Open the app, go to Settings, then Offline Translation, and download the languages you need. Apple Translate also supports offline mode with downloaded languages."
  - question: "How accurate is camera translation?"
    answer: "Camera translation is very helpful for understanding the general meaning of text, especially for common languages like Spanish, French, or German. It may not be perfectly accurate for complex sentences or unusual fonts, but it is reliable for signs, menus, and labels."
  - question: "Can I translate handwritten text with the camera?"
    answer: "The camera can sometimes read clear handwriting, but it works best with printed text. If the handwriting is messy or very small, the app may not recognise it. Try holding your phone steady and close to the text."
  - question: "Is Google Translate free?"
    answer: "Yes, Google Translate is completely free to download and use, including the camera translation feature. Apple Translate is also free and comes pre-installed on iPhones."
  - question: "What languages can I translate with the camera?"
    answer: "Google Translate supports camera translation for over 100 languages. Apple Translate supports fewer languages but covers the most common ones. Both apps are regularly updated with new languages."

## What you will learn

You will learn how to use your phone's camera to translate text in real time. This is useful when you are travelling abroad and need to read a restaurant menu, a street sign, a medicine label, or any text in a foreign language.

## What you need

- A smartphone (iPhone or Android)
- Google Translate app (free, available on both iPhone and Android) or Apple Translate (free, pre-installed on iPhone)
- A Wi-Fi connection or mobile data (or download languages for offline use)

### Step 1: Install Google Translate

If you have an iPhone, you can use the built-in **Translate** app (the icon looks like two speech bubbles). For the best camera translation experience on any phone, open the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Google Play Store** (Android), search for **Google Translate**, and tap **Install**. It is free and works on both types of phone.

### Step 2: Open the app and select your languages

Open **Google Translate**. At the top of the screen, you will see two language buttons. Tap the left button and select the language of the text you want to translate (for example, **French**). Tap the right button and select the language you want to translate into (for example, **English**). If you are not sure what language the text is in, select **Detect Language** on the left.

### Step 3: Tap the camera icon

Below the text box, you will see several icons. Tap the **Camera** icon (it looks like a small camera). Your phone's camera will open inside the app. Point your phone at the text you want to translate. Hold your phone steady, about 15 to 20 centimetres away from the text.

### Step 4: Use instant translation

As soon as you point your camera at text, Google Translate will show the translation directly on your screen, replacing the original text in real time. This is called **Instant** mode. You will see the translated words appear on top of the original text as if the sign or menu was written in your language. Hold your phone steady for the best result.

### Step 5: Take a photo for a clearer translation

If the instant translation is hard to read, tap the **shutter button** (the circle at the bottom of the camera screen) to take a photo. The app will scan the photo and highlight all the text it finds. Tap on any word or drag your finger across a section of text to see its translation at the top of the screen.

### Step 6: Download languages for offline use

If you are going somewhere without internet, download languages in advance. In Google Translate, tap your **profile icon** or the **three lines menu**, then tap **Offline Translation** or **Downloaded Languages**. Find the language you need and tap the **download arrow** next to it. Once downloaded, camera translation will work without Wi-Fi or data.

### Step 7: Try Apple Translate on iPhone

If you have an iPhone, you can also use the built-in **Translate** app. Open it, tap the **Camera** tab at the bottom of the screen, select your languages at the top, and point your camera at the text. The translation appears on screen. This app is simple and works well for the most common languages.

## Tips

- Hold your phone parallel to the text, not at an angle, for the best recognition.
- Good lighting makes a big difference. If the text is in shadow, use your phone's flashlight by tapping the flash icon in the camera view.
- Take a screenshot of important translations so you can refer to them later without opening the app again.
- Download the language packs before you travel so you are prepared even in areas with no internet.
