## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to use the Uber app to book a car ride from your phone. Uber connects you with nearby drivers who will pick you up and take you where you need to go. You do not need to call a taxi or carry cash.

## What you need

- A smartphone (iPhone or Android)
- An internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data)
- A credit card, debit card, or digital payment method
- A phone number for account verification

## The steps

### Step 1: Download the Uber app

Open the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Google Play Store** (Android). Search for **"Uber"** and tap **"Install"** or **"Get"**. Wait for the app to download and then open it.

### Step 2: Create your account

Tap **"Continue"** and enter your **phone number**. Uber will send you a verification code by text message. Type the code to confirm your number. Then enter your **name** and **email address**.

### Step 3: Add a payment method

Tap the menu icon or go to **"Payment"** in the app. Tap **"Add Payment Method"**. Enter your credit card or debit card details. The card will be charged automatically after each ride -- you do not need to pay the driver directly.

### Step 4: Enter your destination

On the main screen, tap the **"Where to?"** box. Type the address or name of the place you want to go. Select it from the suggestions that appear.

### Step 5: Choose your ride type and confirm

Uber will show you different ride options with estimated prices:

- **UberX**: A standard car, the most affordable option
- **Uber Comfort**: A newer car with extra legroom
- **UberXL**: A larger car for groups of up to 6 people

Select the option you prefer and tap **"Confirm UberX"** (or whichever type you chose). A nearby driver will be assigned to your ride.

### Step 6: Wait for your driver

The app will show you the driver's name, photo, car model, and license plate number. You can see the car moving on the map as it approaches your location. When the driver arrives, walk to the car and verify the license plate matches what the app shows.

### Step 7: Ride and rate your driver

Get in the car and enjoy the ride. The app tracks the route automatically. When you arrive at your destination, the payment is processed automatically from your saved card. After the ride, the app will ask you to rate the driver with 1 to 5 stars.

## Helpful tips

- **Share your trip**: Tap the shield icon during a ride to share your live location and trip details with a family member or friend.
- **Schedule a ride**: You can book a ride in advance by tapping the clock icon next to "Where to?" and selecting a future date and time.
- **Save frequent places**: Tap **"Home"** or **"Work"** in the app to save these addresses for quick booking.
- **Check the price first**: Uber always shows the estimated fare before you confirm. If the price seems high, wait a few minutes and check again -- prices change with demand.
