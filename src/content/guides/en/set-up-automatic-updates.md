  - question: "Why are updates important?"
    answer: "Updates fix security problems that hackers could use to access your phone. They also fix bugs and sometimes add new features. Keeping your phone updated is one of the most important things you can do to stay safe."
  - question: "Will updates slow down my phone?"
    answer: "Most updates actually improve your phone's performance. In rare cases, a very old phone may run slightly slower after a major update, but the security benefits are worth it."
  - question: "Do updates use my mobile data?"
    answer: "By default, most phones only download large updates over Wi-Fi. You can check this in your settings to make sure updates only happen when you are connected to Wi-Fi."
  - question: "How long does an update take?"
    answer: "Small app updates take a few seconds. Larger system updates can take 15 to 45 minutes. Your phone may restart during a system update. It is best to start updates when you do not need your phone for a while, such as at bedtime."
  - question: "Can I undo an update if I do not like it?"
    answer: "App updates can sometimes be undone by uninstalling and reinstalling an older version, but this is complicated. System updates cannot be undone. However, problems with updates are rare and usually get fixed in the next update."

## What you will learn

You will learn how to turn on automatic updates for both your apps and your phone's operating system. This ensures your phone stays protected against security threats and runs smoothly without you having to do anything manually.

## What you need

- A smartphone (iPhone or Android)
- A Wi-Fi connection
- Your phone charged to at least 50 percent or plugged in

### Step 1: Update your apps automatically on iPhone

Open the **Settings** app on your iPhone (the gray gear icon). Scroll down and tap **App Store**. Look for the option called **App Updates** and make sure the switch next to it is turned on (green). From now on, your apps will update automatically when your phone is connected to Wi-Fi.

### Step 2: Update your apps automatically on Android

Open the **Google Play Store** app. Tap your **profile picture** in the top-right corner. Tap **Settings**, then tap **Network preferences**. Tap **Auto-update apps** and choose **Over Wi-Fi only**. This will keep all your apps updated automatically without using your mobile data.

### Step 3: Turn on automatic system updates on iPhone

Go back to the main **Settings** screen. Tap **General**, then tap **Software Update**. Tap **Automatic Updates**. Make sure both **Download iOS Updates** and **Install iOS Updates** are turned on. Your iPhone will now download and install system updates overnight while it is charging and connected to Wi-Fi.

### Step 4: Turn on automatic system updates on Android

Open the **Settings** app on your Android phone. Tap **System** (or **Software Update** on some phones). Tap **Software Update** or **System Update**. Look for an option called **Auto download over Wi-Fi** or **Download updates automatically** and turn it on. The exact wording varies by phone brand, but the option is usually in this section.

### Step 5: Check for updates right now

To make sure everything is current, check for updates manually. On iPhone, go to **Settings**, then **General**, then **Software Update**. On Android, go to **Settings**, then **System**, then **Software Update** and tap **Check for updates**. If an update is available, tap **Download and Install**. For apps, open the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Play Store** (Android) and tap **Update All**.

### Step 6: Verify updates are working

After a few days, check that updates are happening automatically. Open the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Play Store** (Android) and go to your installed apps. If most apps show "Open" instead of "Update," automatic updates are working correctly. You can also check your system version in **Settings** then **About Phone** to see the last update date.

## Tips

- Keep your phone connected to Wi-Fi at night so updates can download while you sleep
- Make sure your phone is charging overnight -- system updates need at least 50 percent battery
- If an app looks or works differently after an update, give it a day -- you will get used to the new design
- Turn on automatic updates for your phone's security apps first if you cannot update everything at once
- Check for updates manually once a month to make sure nothing was missed
