  - question: "How long does the transfer take?"
    answer: "It depends on how much data you have. For most people it takes between 15 minutes and one hour. If you have many photos and videos, it may take longer. Keep both phones plugged into power during the transfer."
  - question: "Do I need my old phone to set up the new one?"

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to set up a brand new phone and move everything from your old phone to the new one. This includes your contacts, photos, messages, and apps. The steps work for both iPhone and Android.

## What you need

- Your new phone, charged to at least 50%
- Your old phone (if you still have it), also charged
- Your Wi-Fi network name and password
- Your Apple ID (for iPhone) or Google account (for Android) email and password
- About 30 to 60 minutes of free time

### Step 1: Charge both phones and connect to Wi-Fi

Before you begin, plug both your old phone and your new phone into their chargers. The transfer uses a lot of battery, so it is important that both phones have plenty of power. Turn on your new phone by pressing and holding the **power button** on the side. Follow the first few screens to choose your language and connect to your **Wi-Fi network**.

### Step 2: Start the setup assistant

Your new phone will show a welcome screen and guide you through the first steps. On an iPhone, you will see **Hello** on the screen. Swipe up or press the **Home button** to begin. On an Android phone, you will see a **Start** or **Let's go** button. Tap it to continue.

### Step 3: Sign in with your account

The phone will ask you to sign in. On an iPhone, enter your **Apple ID** email address and password. This is the account you used on your old iPhone. On an Android phone, enter your **Google account** email address and password. This connects your new phone to your cloud backup and app purchases.

### Step 4: Choose to transfer data from your old phone

During setup, the phone will ask if you want to transfer data from another device.

- **iPhone to iPhone:** Hold your old iPhone near the new one. A pattern will appear on the new phone's screen. Point your old phone's camera at the pattern. The phones will connect and begin the transfer automatically.
- **Android to Android:** The new phone will ask if you want to copy data. Tap **Next** and follow the prompts. You may need to open **Settings** on your old phone and search for **Set up nearby device**, or use a cable if prompted.
- **Android to iPhone:** On the setup screen, tap **Move Data from Android**. On your old Android phone, download the free **Move to iOS** app from the Google Play Store, open it, and follow the instructions to connect.
- **iPhone to Android:** On the setup screen, the new Android phone will guide you to connect. You may need to use a cable or download the **Switch to Android** app on your iPhone.

### Step 5: Wait for the transfer to finish

The transfer may take anywhere from 15 minutes to over an hour depending on how much data you have. You will see a progress bar on the screen. Do not disconnect or turn off either phone during the transfer. Keep both phones connected to their chargers and to Wi-Fi.

### Step 6: Set up security on your new phone

After the transfer is complete, your new phone will ask you to set up a way to unlock it. You can choose a **PIN code** (a number you type each time), **fingerprint**, or **face recognition**. Pick the method that feels most comfortable. A PIN code of at least six digits is a good choice if you are not sure.

### Step 7: Check that everything transferred correctly

Once setup is done, open a few apps to make sure your data arrived. Check your **Contacts** app to see if your phone numbers are there. Open **Photos** to see your pictures. Open **Messages** to check your text conversations. If anything is missing, you can usually find it by signing into your cloud account (iCloud or Google) again, or by running the transfer a second time.

## Tips

- Write down your Apple ID or Google account password before you start. You will need it during setup.
- If the wireless transfer is very slow, check if both phones are on the same Wi-Fi network.
- Some apps will need to be downloaded again from the App Store or Google Play Store after the transfer. They will appear on your home screen but may show a cloud icon until they finish downloading.
- After setup, keep your old phone for a few weeks before erasing it, in case you notice something that did not transfer.
