## What you will learn

You will learn how to install the Kindle app on your phone, find and download books, adjust the text size for comfortable reading, and use bookmarks to save your place.

## What you need

- A smartphone (iPhone or Android)
- A Wi-Fi connection or mobile data
- A free Amazon account

### Step 1: Install the Kindle app

Open the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Google Play Store** (Android). Tap the search bar and type **Kindle**. Find the app called **Kindle** by AMZN Mobile LLC. Tap **Get** or **Install**. Wait for it to download and then tap **Open**.

### Step 2: Sign in with your Amazon account

When the app opens, it will ask you to sign in. Type your Amazon email address and password, then tap **Sign In**. If you do not have an Amazon account, tap **Create a new Amazon account** and follow the instructions. You only need an email address and a password.

### Step 3: Find a book to read

Tap the **Discover** or **Store** tab at the bottom of the screen. You can browse by category such as Mystery, Romance, History, or Biography. You can also tap the **Search** icon and type the name of a book or author you like. To find free books, search for "free ebooks" or browse the Top Free section.

### Step 4: Download a book

When you find a book you want, tap on it to see its description and reviews. Tap **Buy Now** for paid books or **Get** for free books. The book will download to your Kindle library automatically. Go back to the **Library** tab to see all your downloaded books.

### Step 5: Start reading

Tap the book cover in your Library to open it. The book will appear on your screen like a real page. To turn to the next page, swipe your finger from right to left across the screen, or tap the right side of the screen. To go back a page, swipe from left to right or tap the left side.

### Step 6: Make the text bigger

Tap the center of the screen to show the menu bar. Tap the **Aa** button at the top. You will see options to change the text size. Drag the slider to make the text bigger or smaller. You can also change the font style and the background color. Try the sepia (warm yellow) background for easier reading at night.

### Step 7: Use bookmarks and highlights

To save your place, tap the top-right corner of any page. A small bookmark icon will appear. To find your bookmarks later, tap the center of the screen and then tap the **bookmark** icon or **Go To** in the menu. You can also press and hold on a word to highlight it or look up its definition.

## Tips

- Read with your phone in portrait mode (upright) for the best experience
- Turn on **Do Not Disturb** while reading so notifications do not interrupt you
- Use a larger text size and warm background color to reduce eye strain
- The app remembers where you stopped, so you can close it and come back anytime
- Borrow free eBooks from your local library using the Libby app, and read them in Kindle
