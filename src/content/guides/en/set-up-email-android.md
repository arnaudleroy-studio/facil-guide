## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to add your email account to your Android phone. Once set up, you can read, send, and receive emails directly from your phone without opening a web browser.

## What you need

- An Android phone
- Your email address and password
- An internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data)

## The steps

### Step 1: Open the Gmail app

Find and tap the **Gmail** app on your phone. It has a colorful envelope icon with red, blue, yellow, and green stripes. If you cannot find it, swipe down on your home screen and type **"Gmail"** in the search bar.

### Step 2: Start adding your account

If this is your first time opening Gmail, tap **"Add an email address"**. If you already use Gmail and want to add another account, tap your **profile picture** in the top right corner, then tap **"Add another account"**.

### Step 3: Choose your email provider

You will see a list of email providers. Tap the one that matches your email:

- **Google** for Gmail addresses (ending in @gmail.com)
- **Outlook, Hotmail, and Live** for Microsoft email addresses
- **Yahoo** for Yahoo email addresses
- **Other** for any other email provider

### Step 4: Enter your email address

Type your full email address (for example, yourname@gmail.com) and tap **"Next"**.

### Step 5: Enter your password

Type your email password and tap **"Next"**. If your account uses two-step verification, you may need to enter a code sent to your phone or approve a notification on another device.

### Step 6: Accept the terms

Read and accept any terms or permissions that appear. Tap **"I agree"** or **"Accept"** to continue.

### Step 7: Start using your email

Your inbox will load with your recent emails. New emails will arrive automatically. You will see a notification on your phone when a new email comes in.

To **send an email**, tap the **pencil icon** (or **"Compose"** button) at the bottom right corner of the screen.

## Helpful tips

- **Switch between accounts**: If you have multiple email accounts, tap your **profile picture** in the top right corner of Gmail to switch between them.
- **Organize with labels**: Swipe left or right on an email to archive or delete it. This keeps your inbox clean.
- **Search your emails**: Tap the **search bar** at the top of the Gmail app to find a specific email by keyword, sender, or subject.
- **Turn off notifications**: If you receive too many notifications, go to **Settings** in the Gmail app, tap your email account, and adjust the notification settings.
