  - question: "Why are the keys on my phone so small?"
    answer: "Phone keyboards are designed to fit on a small screen. But you can make them bigger by changing your display settings, using landscape mode, or installing a keyboard app with larger keys."
  - question: "Will a bigger keyboard hide my messages?"
    answer: "A bigger keyboard takes up more space on the screen, so you will see fewer lines of your conversation while typing. But once you close the keyboard, everything goes back to normal."
  - question: "Can I make just the letters bigger without changing the whole keyboard?"
    answer: "Some keyboard apps let you increase the font size on the keys without making the keyboard itself bigger. Check the keyboard settings for a font size or key label option."
  - question: "What if I still make mistakes when typing?"
    answer: "Turn on autocorrect in your keyboard settings. It will fix most common typos automatically. You can also try voice typing instead -- just tap the microphone icon on the keyboard and speak your message."
  - question: "Does this work for all apps?"
    answer: "Yes, once you change your keyboard settings, the bigger keyboard appears in all apps where you type, including messages, email, WhatsApp, and search."

## What you will learn

You will learn several ways to make your phone keyboard bigger and easier to use. You will learn how to adjust display settings, use landscape mode, and change keyboard settings for larger keys.

## What you need

- A smartphone (iPhone or Android)

### Step 1: Try landscape mode for a wider keyboard

Turn your phone sideways so the screen is horizontal. The keyboard will automatically become wider, giving you bigger keys. This works in most apps. If the screen does not rotate, open **Settings**, look for **Display** or **Accessibility**, and make sure **Auto-Rotate** (Android) or **Portrait Orientation Lock** is turned off (iPhone -- check Control Center).

### Step 2: Increase display zoom on iPhone

Open the **Settings** app. Tap **Display and Brightness**. Tap **Display Zoom** (at the bottom of the screen). Choose **Larger Text** and tap **Done**. Your iPhone will restart and everything on screen, including the keyboard, will appear bigger. This is the easiest way to get a larger keyboard on iPhone.

### Step 3: Increase display size on Android

Open the **Settings** app. Tap **Display** (or **Display and Brightness**). Look for **Display Size**, **Screen Zoom**, or **Display Size and Text**. Move the slider to the right to make everything bigger, including the keyboard. The preview at the top shows you what it will look like. Tap **Apply** when you are happy with the size.

### Step 4: Adjust keyboard height on Android

Many Android phones let you resize the keyboard directly. Open any app where you can type to bring up the keyboard. Look for a **gear icon** or **settings icon** on the keyboard. Tap it and look for **Keyboard Size**, **Keyboard Height**, or **Layout**. Drag the edges of the keyboard to make it taller. On Samsung phones, open **Settings**, then **General Management**, then **Samsung Keyboard Settings**, then **Size and Transparency**.

### Step 5: Use one-handed mode for easier reach

If the keyboard is too wide and your thumb cannot reach all the keys, try one-handed mode. On most keyboards, press and hold the **comma key** or the **globe icon** at the bottom of the keyboard. You will see an option to shrink the keyboard to the left or right side of the screen. This makes it easier to type with one hand while keeping the keys a good size.

### Step 6: Try voice typing instead

If typing on a small keyboard is still difficult, use voice typing. Tap the **microphone icon** on the keyboard (usually at the bottom or next to the space bar). Speak your message clearly and your phone will type it for you. Tap the microphone again to stop. This is often the easiest option for longer messages.

## Tips

- Landscape mode gives you the widest keyboard but does not work in all apps
- Display zoom makes everything bigger, not just the keyboard, which also helps with reading
- If you install a third-party keyboard, make sure it is from a trusted developer
- Practice typing with your index finger if your thumbs are too wide for the keys
- Voice typing works well for messages but check for mistakes before sending
