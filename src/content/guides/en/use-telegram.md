## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to install and use Telegram on your phone. Telegram is a free messaging app that lets you send text messages, photos, videos, and voice notes to anyone who also uses Telegram. It is similar to WhatsApp but offers some extra features like larger group chats and bigger file sharing.

## What you need

- An iPhone or Android phone
- A mobile phone number (to create your account)
- An internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data)

## The steps

### Step 1: Download Telegram

Open the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Google Play Store** (Android) and search for **Telegram**. Tap **Install** or **Get** to download the app. It is a blue icon with a white paper aeroplane inside.

### Step 2: Create your account

Open Telegram and tap **Start Messaging**. Enter your phone number and tap **Next**. Telegram will send you a verification code by text message. Enter the code when it arrives. Then type your first name (and optionally your last name) and tap **Next**. Your account is now ready.

### Step 3: Find your contacts

Telegram will ask for permission to access your contacts. Tap **Allow** so it can show you which of your friends and family already use Telegram. You will see their names in your contact list, ready for you to message them.

### Step 4: Send a text message

Tap on a contact's name to open a conversation. Tap the **message box** at the bottom of the screen, type your message, and tap the **send button** (a blue arrow icon). Your message will appear in the conversation as a blue bubble.

### Step 5: Send a photo

To share a photo, open a conversation and tap the **paperclip icon** (Android) or the **plus icon** (iPhone) next to the message box. Choose **Photo or Video** or **Gallery**. Select the photo you want to send and tap the **send button**. You can add a caption before sending if you want to describe the photo.

### Step 6: Send a voice message

To send a voice message instead of typing, press and hold the **microphone icon** on the right side of the message box. Speak your message clearly while holding the button. Release the button when you are finished. The voice message will be sent automatically.

### Step 7: Start a new conversation

To message someone new, tap the **pencil icon** (or the compose button) in the bottom right corner of the main screen. You will see a list of your contacts who use Telegram. Tap the person's name to start a new conversation. If they are not on Telegram yet, you can invite them by tapping **Invite Friends**.

## Tips

- You can delete a message you sent by mistake. Tap and hold the message, then tap **Delete**. Choose **Delete for Everyone** to remove it from both sides.
- Telegram lets you send files up to 2 gigabytes, which is useful for sharing large videos or documents.
- You can pin important conversations to the top of your chat list by pressing and holding a chat and tapping **Pin**.
- To change your profile photo, go to **Settings** (tap the three lines in the top left), tap your name, then tap the camera icon.
