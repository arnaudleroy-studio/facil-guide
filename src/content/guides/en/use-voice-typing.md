  - question: "Why does voice typing get some words wrong?"
    answer: "Voice typing may misunderstand words that sound similar or if there is background noise. Speak clearly, hold the phone close, and dictate in a quiet place for best results. You can always tap on a word to correct it afterwards."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to use voice typing on your phone. Instead of tapping each letter on the keyboard, you can speak and your phone will type the words for you. This is useful when you find the keyboard too small, when your hands are busy, or when you prefer speaking to typing.

## What you need

- An iPhone or Android phone with a microphone (all phones have one)
- A reasonably quiet environment for best results

## Steps

### Step 1: Open any app where you can type

Open any app that uses the keyboard. For example, open **Messages** to write a text, **WhatsApp** to send a message, **Notes** to write a note, or **Gmail** to compose an email. Tap in the text area so the keyboard appears on screen.

### Step 2: Find the microphone button on your keyboard

Look at your keyboard. On an iPhone, the **microphone** icon is at the bottom-right of the keyboard, near the space bar. On Android, the microphone icon is usually in the top row of the keyboard or next to the space bar. It looks like a small microphone.

### Step 3: Tap the microphone and start speaking

Tap the **microphone** icon. The keyboard will change to show a waveform or a listening indicator, which means your phone is ready to hear you. Start speaking clearly at a normal pace. Your words will appear as text on the screen as you speak.

### Step 4: Add punctuation by saying it

When you want to add punctuation, say it out loud. Say **"period"** or **"full stop"** to add a dot. Say **"comma"** for a comma. Say **"question mark"** for a question mark. Say **"new line"** to move to the next line. Say **"new paragraph"** to start a new paragraph.

### Step 5: Stop dictating and review your text

When you are finished speaking, tap the **microphone** icon again or tap the **keyboard** icon to switch back to typing. Read through the text your phone typed. If any words are wrong, tap on the incorrect word and correct it using the keyboard.

### Step 6: Send or save your message

Once you are happy with the text, send or save it as you normally would. Tap **Send** in a messaging app, or **Save** in a notes app. You can combine voice typing with regular typing in the same message. Switch between them whenever you want.

## Tips

- Speak at a natural pace. Speaking too fast or too slowly can reduce accuracy.
- If your phone keeps getting words wrong, try moving to a quieter place. Background noise is the most common reason for errors.
- You can use voice typing for long texts like emails. It is much faster than typing letter by letter on the keyboard.
- Practice with short messages first to get comfortable, then try longer texts.
