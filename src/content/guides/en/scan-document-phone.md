  - question: "Do I need to download a special app to scan documents?"
    answer: "No. iPhones have a built-in scanner in the Notes app and the Files app. Android phones running Google Drive also have a built-in scanner. You do not need to download anything extra."
  - question: "Is a phone scan as good as a real scanner?"
    answer: "For everyday use, yes. Phone scanners automatically straighten the page, improve contrast, and create clear PDF files. For official documents, most offices and banks accept phone scans."
  - question: "Can I scan multiple pages into one document?"
    answer: "Yes. Both the iPhone Notes scanner and Google Drive scanner let you scan several pages one after the other and save them all as a single PDF file."
  - question: "How do I share the scanned document?"
    answer: "After scanning, tap the share button to send it by email, WhatsApp, or any other app. You can also save it to your phone's files or to cloud storage like iCloud or Google Drive."
  - question: "What if the scan looks blurry?"
    answer: "Make sure there is good lighting on the document. Hold your phone steady directly above the page. Avoid shadows falling on the paper. The phone will usually take a clearer scan in bright, even light."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to use your phone's camera to scan paper documents and turn them into digital files. This is useful for keeping copies of important letters, receipts, prescriptions, or forms without needing a separate scanner or printer.

## What you need

- An iPhone or Android phone with a camera
- The document you want to scan (a letter, receipt, form, or any paper)
- A flat, well-lit surface to place the document on

### Step 1: Place the document on a flat surface

Lay the paper document flat on a table or desk. Make sure the area is well lit, ideally near a window or under a lamp. Smooth out any wrinkles or folds so the text is easy to read. Avoid dark or shadowy spots.

### Step 2: Open the scanner on iPhone

Open the **Notes** app. Tap the **New Note** button (the square with a pen icon at the bottom right). Tap the **Camera** icon above the keyboard, then tap **Scan Documents**. Your camera will open in scanning mode.

### Step 3: Open the scanner on Android

Open the **Google Drive** app. Tap the **+** button at the bottom right. Tap **Scan**. Your camera will open in scanning mode. If you do not have Google Drive, you can download it free from the **Play Store**.

### Step 4: Point your camera at the document

Hold your phone above the document so the entire page fits on the screen. Keep your phone parallel to the paper (not at an angle). The scanner will automatically detect the edges of the document. On iPhone, it may capture automatically. On Android, tap the **shutter button** (the round button) to capture.

### Step 5: Adjust the corners if needed

After capturing, you will see the scanned image with four corner handles. If the edges are not perfectly aligned with the document, drag each **corner handle** to match the edges of the paper. This ensures only the document is included and not the table around it. Tap **Keep Scan** on iPhone or the **checkmark** on Android.

### Step 6: Add more pages or finish

If you have more pages to scan, point your camera at the next page and repeat. The scanner will add each page to the same document. When you are done scanning all pages, tap **Save** on iPhone or the **Save** button on Android.

### Step 7: Share or save the scanned document

On iPhone, the scan is saved inside your note. Tap the scan, then tap the **Share** button (the square with an arrow) to send it by email or message. On Android, the scan is saved as a PDF in your Google Drive. Tap the file, then tap the **three dots** menu and choose **Share** to send it.

## Tips

- Clean your phone's camera lens with a soft cloth before scanning for the sharpest results
- If scanning a small receipt, place it on a contrasting background (like a dark receipt on a white table) so the scanner detects the edges better
- For important documents, scan in good natural light rather than under dim artificial light
- You can rename the scanned file to something descriptive like "Electric bill January" so you can find it later easily
