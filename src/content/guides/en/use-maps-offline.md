  - question: "How much storage space do offline maps use?"
    answer: "It depends on the area size. A city map typically uses 50 to 200 megabytes. A large region or country can use over 1 gigabyte. Check your phone storage before downloading large areas."
  - question: "Do offline maps include traffic information?"
    answer: "No. Traffic information requires an internet connection. Offline maps give you directions and street names, but cannot show live traffic or suggest faster routes based on current conditions."
  - question: "How long do downloaded maps stay on my phone?"
    answer: "Google Maps keeps offline maps for about one year and then asks you to update them. Apple Maps keeps them until you delete them manually."
  - question: "Can I search for places on offline maps?"
    answer: "Yes, but with limitations. You can search for addresses and some businesses. However, you will not see reviews, opening hours, or phone numbers without an internet connection."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to download maps to your phone before you travel. This way, you can get directions and find places even when you have no internet connection. This is very useful when travelling abroad, visiting rural areas, or when your mobile data is limited.

## What you need

- A phone with **Google Maps** (iPhone or Android) or **Apple Maps** (iPhone only)
- A Wi-Fi connection to download the maps before your trip
- Enough free storage space on your phone (at least 500 megabytes recommended)

## Steps

### Step 1: Open Google Maps or Apple Maps

On your phone, tap the **Google Maps** app (the colourful map pin icon) or the **Apple Maps** app (the map icon with coloured lines). If you do not have Google Maps, you can download it for free from the App Store or Google Play Store.

### Step 2: Search for the area you need

In the **search bar** at the top, type the name of the city, region, or country you will be visiting. For example, type "Lisbon" or "Paris." The map will move to show that area.

### Step 3: Download the map in Google Maps

In Google Maps, tap on your **profile picture** or initials in the top-right corner. Then tap **Offline maps**. Tap **Select your own map**. A blue rectangle will appear on the map. Move and zoom to cover the area you need. Then tap **Download**. The map will start downloading.

### Step 4: Download the map in Apple Maps

In Apple Maps, tap your **profile picture** or initials in the bottom-right corner. Tap **Offline Maps**, then tap **Download New Map**. Search for the area you want. Adjust the blue rectangle to cover the area you need. Tap **Download**. Wait for the download to finish.

### Step 5: Get directions while offline

When you are in the area you downloaded and have no internet, open the maps app as you normally would. Type a destination in the search bar. The app will calculate a route using the downloaded map. Tap **Go** to start navigation. The app will give you turn-by-turn directions using your downloaded map.

### Step 6: Manage your offline maps

To see which maps you have downloaded, go to your profile and tap **Offline maps** (Google Maps) or **Offline Maps** (Apple Maps). From here, you can update a map, delete maps you no longer need to free up space, or download additional areas for future trips.

## Tips

- Download maps before you leave home while you are connected to Wi-Fi. Downloading over mobile data can be slow and expensive.
- Download a larger area than you think you need. You might take a detour or explore places outside your planned route.
- Update your offline maps before each trip to make sure you have the latest roads and information.
- If you are travelling to multiple cities, download each area separately so you can delete them one by one when you are done.
