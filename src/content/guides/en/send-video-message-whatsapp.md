  - question: "What is the difference between a video message and a video call?"
    answer: "A video message is a short recorded clip that you send like a text message. The other person watches it when they have time. A video call is a live conversation where you see and hear each other in real time."
  - question: "How long can a video message be?"
    answer: "Instant video messages recorded with the camera button can be up to 60 seconds. If you want to send a longer video, record it with your phone's camera app first and then share it through WhatsApp as an attachment."
  - question: "Does sending video messages use a lot of data?"
    answer: "Video messages use more data than text or voice messages, but WhatsApp compresses them to keep the file size small. A short video message typically uses 1 to 5 megabytes. Use Wi-Fi when possible to avoid using your mobile data."
  - question: "Can the other person save my video message?"
    answer: "Yes, the person who receives your video message can save it to their phone. Keep this in mind when recording personal content."
  - question: "Why is my video message blurry?"
    answer: "WhatsApp compresses videos to send them faster. Make sure your camera lens is clean and hold your phone steady while recording. Good lighting also helps improve video quality."

## What you will learn

You will learn how to record and send short video messages directly in WhatsApp. You will also learn how to send videos you have already recorded, and how to add captions to your videos before sending them.

## What you need

- A smartphone (iPhone or Android) with WhatsApp installed
- A Wi-Fi connection or mobile data
- Permission for WhatsApp to use your camera (the app will ask the first time)

### Step 1: Open a chat in WhatsApp

Tap the **WhatsApp** icon on your home screen. Find the conversation with the person you want to send a video message to and tap on it. If you have not chatted with them before, tap the **New Chat** button and select their name from your contacts.

### Step 2: Record an instant video message

In the chat, look at the bottom of the screen next to the text box. You will see a **camera icon** or a small circle. Press and hold the **camera icon** to start recording a video message. While holding, you will see yourself on screen. The recording starts immediately. Release the button when you are done. The video is sent automatically.

### Step 3: Switch between front and rear camera

While recording your video message, you can tap the **camera flip** button (usually two arrows forming a circle) to switch between the front camera (selfie view) and the rear camera. The front camera is best for recording yourself. The rear camera is useful for showing something around you.

### Step 4: Send a video you already recorded

If you already have a video saved on your phone, tap the **paperclip icon** (Android) or the **plus icon** (iPhone) in the chat. Tap **Gallery** or **Photo and Video Library**. Browse through your videos and tap the one you want to send. You can trim the video by dragging the edges of the timeline bar. Add a caption if you like, then tap the **Send** button.

### Step 5: Add a caption to your video

When you select a video from your gallery, WhatsApp shows a preview screen before sending. At the bottom of this screen, you will see a text box where you can type a caption. This text appears below the video in the chat. Use it to explain what the video shows or add a personal message.

### Step 6: View a video message you received

When someone sends you a video message, it appears in your chat as a small circle or thumbnail. Tap on it to play the video. The video plays once automatically. Tap it again to replay it. If it is a video from the gallery, tap the play button to watch it in full screen.

## Tips

- Keep video messages short and to the point, 15 to 30 seconds is ideal
- Face a window or light source so your face is well lit when recording with the front camera
- Hold your phone steady with both hands for a clearer video
- Record in a quiet place so the other person can hear you clearly
- Check the video before sending, especially if you are sending one from your gallery
