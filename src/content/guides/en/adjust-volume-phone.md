  - question: "Why can I not hear the other person during a phone call?"
    answer: "During a call, press the volume up button on the side of your phone to increase the call volume. If it is still too quiet, check if your phone case is covering the earpiece speaker at the top of the phone."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to control the volume on your phone. Your phone has several different volume controls: one for phone calls, one for music and videos, one for your ringtone, and one for alarms. You will learn how to adjust each one so you can hear everything clearly.

## What you need

- An iPhone or Android phone

## The steps

### Step 1: Find the volume buttons on your phone

Look at the left side of your phone (iPhone) or the right side (most Android phones). You will see two buttons, one above the other. The **top button** makes the volume louder. The **bottom button** makes the volume quieter. These are your volume buttons.

### Step 2: Adjust the volume during a phone call

When you are on a phone call, press the **volume up button** to hear the other person more clearly, or the **volume down button** to make them quieter. A volume bar will appear on your screen showing the current level. The call volume is only adjusted while you are in a call.

### Step 3: Adjust the media volume for videos and music

When you are watching a video or listening to music, press the **volume up** or **volume down** buttons to change how loud it is. This is called the media volume. It is separate from your ringtone volume, so changing it will not affect how loud your phone rings.

### Step 4: Adjust the ringtone volume

To change how loud your phone rings when someone calls you:

**On iPhone:** Go to **Settings** > **Sounds & Haptics**. Drag the **Ringer and Alerts** slider to the right to make it louder, or to the left to make it quieter.

**On Android:** Go to **Settings** > **Sound** (or **Sound and vibration**). Drag the **Ring volume** slider to adjust the level.

### Step 5: Adjust the alarm volume

To make sure you can hear your alarm in the morning:

**On iPhone:** Go to **Settings** > **Sounds & Haptics**. The **Ringer and Alerts** slider also controls the alarm volume.

**On Android:** Go to **Settings** > **Sound**. You will see a separate **Alarm volume** slider. Drag it to the right to make your alarm louder.

### Step 6: Put your phone on silent mode

Sometimes you need your phone to be completely silent, for example in a church or during a medical appointment.

**On iPhone:** Flip the small **switch on the left side** of your phone down (towards the back of the phone). You will see a small orange line on the switch and feel a vibration. Your phone is now on silent. Flip it back up to turn the sound on again.

**On Android:** Press the **volume down button** several times until you see a silent or vibrate icon on screen. Or go to **Settings** > **Sound** and choose **Silent mode** or **Do Not Disturb**.

## Tips

- If you wear hearing aids, check if your phone has a hearing aid compatibility mode. On iPhone, go to **Settings** > **Accessibility** > **Hearing Devices**.
- When watching videos on speaker, cup your hand around the bottom of the phone (where the speaker is) to make it sound louder.
- If your ringtone is too quiet even at maximum volume, try choosing a different ringtone. Some ringtones are naturally louder than others.
- The volume buttons work differently depending on what you are doing. During a call they adjust call volume, during a video they adjust media volume, and on the home screen they adjust ringtone volume.
