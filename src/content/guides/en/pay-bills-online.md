  - question: "Is it safe to pay bills on my phone?"
    answer: "Yes, paying through your official bank app is very safe. Banks use strong encryption to protect your information. Just make sure you download your bank's official app from the App Store or Google Play Store, not from a link someone sends you."
  - question: "What if I pay the wrong amount?"
    answer: "Most banks let you cancel or modify a payment if it has not been processed yet. Check your payment history in the app right after paying. If the payment already went through, contact your bank's customer service for help."
  - question: "Do I need to pay a fee to pay bills online?"
    answer: "Most banks offer free online bill pay. Some billers may charge a small convenience fee if you pay by credit card, but paying directly from your bank account is usually free."
  - question: "Can I set up automatic payments?"
    answer: "Yes, most bank apps let you set up recurring payments for bills that are the same amount each month, like your phone bill or insurance. Look for an option called Autopay or Recurring Payment when setting up the payment."
  - question: "What if I do not have a bank app?"
    answer: "You can also pay bills through your bank's website using the internet browser on your phone. Go to your bank's website, log in, and look for the Bill Pay section. You can also visit the biller's website directly to make a payment."

## What you will learn

You will learn how to use your phone to pay household bills like electricity, water, phone, and internet. You will learn how to set up a payee, make a one-time payment, and check that the payment went through.

## What you need

- A smartphone (iPhone or Android)
- Your bank's mobile app installed and set up
- Your bank account login details
- A bill with the account number and amount due

### Step 1: Open your bank app

Find your bank's app on your phone and tap it to open. Log in using your username and password, or use fingerprint or face recognition if you have set it up. If you do not have the app yet, go to the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Google Play Store** (Android), search for your bank's name, and install the official app.

### Step 2: Find the Bill Pay section

Once logged in, look for a section called **Bill Pay**, **Pay Bills**, or **Payments**. It is usually on the main screen or inside a menu. Tap on it. Some banks put it under **Transfers & Payments** or a **More** menu at the bottom of the screen.

### Step 3: Add a new payee

Tap **Add Payee** or **Add a Biller**. Search for the company you want to pay, such as your electric company or phone provider. Select it from the list. If the company is not listed, you can add it manually by typing the company name and address from your bill.

### Step 4: Enter your account number

Type in the account number from your bill. This is the number the company uses to identify you as a customer. Double-check it carefully -- a wrong number could send your payment to someone else. You usually find this number at the top of your paper bill or in the biller's app or website.

### Step 5: Enter the payment amount and date

Type the amount you want to pay. Check your bill for the exact amount due. Then choose the date you want the payment to be sent. You can pay immediately or schedule it for a future date, such as the day before the due date.

### Step 6: Review and confirm the payment

The app will show you a summary with the payee name, your account number, the amount, and the date. Read everything carefully. If it all looks correct, tap **Confirm**, **Submit**, or **Pay Now**. You may need to enter a code sent to your phone or confirm with your fingerprint.

### Step 7: Check that the payment went through

Go back to the main screen and tap **Activity**, **Transactions**, or **Payment History**. You should see your payment listed as pending or completed. Keep this as your record. If the payment does not appear within a few minutes, try refreshing the page or contact your bank.

## Tips

- Pay a day or two before the due date to avoid late fees, even when paying electronically
- Save a screenshot of the confirmation screen as proof of payment
- Start with one small bill to get comfortable before paying all your bills online
- Never pay a bill from a link in an email or text message -- always open your bank app directly
- If your bill amount changes each month, check the new amount before paying
