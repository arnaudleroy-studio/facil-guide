  - question: "Will the reminder ring even if my phone is on silent?"
    answer: "Alarms on iPhone will sound even when the phone is on silent mode. On Android, alarms also ring on silent by default. However, if your phone is in Do Not Disturb mode, you may need to allow alarms in your Do Not Disturb settings."
  - question: "Can I set reminders for different medications at different times?"
    answer: "Yes. You can create multiple alarms or reminders, one for each medication and each time of day. Name each one with the medication name so you know which pill to take."

  - question: "What if I need to take medication only on certain days?"
    answer: "When creating an alarm, you can choose which days of the week it should repeat. For example, you can set it to ring only on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday."
  - question: "Is there a free app for medication reminders?"

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to set up daily reminders on your phone to take your medication on time. You do not need to download any special app. Your phone has built-in tools that can alert you every day at the same time with a sound and a message telling you which medication to take.

## What you need

- An iPhone or Android phone
- The name of your medication and the time you need to take it
- Your phone charged and turned on at the time of the reminder

### Step 1: Decide which method to use

There are two simple ways to set medication reminders. You can use the **Clock** app to set a daily alarm, or you can use the **Reminders** app (iPhone) or **Google Clock/Calendar** (Android) for a named reminder. For most people, a daily alarm with a label is the easiest option.

### Step 2: Open the Clock app

Find and tap the **Clock** app on your phone. On iPhone, it has a white clock face icon. On Android, it may be called **Clock** with a round clock icon. If you cannot find it, swipe down on your home screen and type "Clock" in the search bar.

### Step 3: Create a new alarm

Tap the **Alarm** tab at the bottom of the screen. Tap the **+** button (or **Add alarm**) to create a new alarm. Set the time to when you need to take your medication. For example, if you take a pill at 8:00 in the morning, set the alarm to 8:00 AM.

### Step 4: Name the alarm with your medication

Tap the **Label** field (iPhone) or **Label** option (Android). Type the name of your medication, for example "Blood pressure pill" or "Vitamin D". This label will appear on your screen when the alarm rings so you know exactly which medication to take.

### Step 5: Set the alarm to repeat daily

Tap **Repeat** and select every day of the week (Monday through Sunday) so the alarm rings at the same time every day. If you only take the medication on certain days, select only those days. Tap **Save** or **Done** when finished.

### Step 6: Set up additional alarms for other medications

If you take more than one medication at different times, repeat the steps above to create a separate alarm for each one. For example, one alarm at 8:00 AM labelled "Morning pills" and another at 8:00 PM labelled "Evening pills". Each alarm will have its own label and time.

### Step 7: Use Apple Health for medication tracking on iPhone

If you have an iPhone, open the **Health** app (the white icon with a red heart). Tap **Browse** at the bottom, then tap **Medications**. Tap **Add Medication** and follow the steps to enter the medication name, dosage, and schedule. The Health app will send you reminders and let you log each dose you take.

## Tips

- Place your medication next to where you keep your phone at night so when the alarm rings in the morning, the pills are right there
- If you often dismiss alarms without thinking, set two alarms five minutes apart as a backup
- Ask a family member to help you set up the alarms if you find it difficult the first time
- Keep your phone volume turned up so you can hear the alarm, especially if you are hard of hearing
