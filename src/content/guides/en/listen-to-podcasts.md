## What you will learn

You will learn what podcasts are, how to find them on your phone, and how to listen to your first episode. You will also learn how to subscribe to shows you like and download episodes to listen offline.

## What you need

- A smartphone (iPhone or Android)
- A Wi-Fi connection or mobile data
- Earphones or headphones (optional but recommended)

### Step 1: Open a podcast app

On iPhone, find the **Podcasts** app on your home screen. It has a purple icon with a radio signal. On Android, open the **Google Play Store** and search for **Spotify** or another podcast app, then install it. If you already have **Spotify** on your phone, you can use it for podcasts too.

### Step 2: Browse popular podcasts

When you open the app, you will see a section with popular or featured podcasts. These are organized by category such as News, Health, Comedy, and True Crime. Tap any category that interests you to see a list of shows.

### Step 3: Search for a specific topic

Tap the **Search** tab (usually a magnifying glass icon at the bottom of the screen). Type a topic you are interested in, such as "gardening," "history," or "meditation." The app will show you podcasts related to that topic. Tap one to see its description and episodes.

### Step 4: Play your first episode

When you find a podcast you want to try, you will see a list of episodes. Tap on an episode to see its description. Tap the **Play** button to start listening. You can pause at any time by tapping the **pause** button. Use the slider to skip forward or backward in the episode.

### Step 5: Subscribe to a podcast

If you enjoy a show and want to hear new episodes automatically, tap **Follow** or **Subscribe** (the wording depends on the app). This means new episodes will appear in your library as soon as they are released, so you never miss one.

### Step 6: Download an episode for offline listening

Find an episode you want to save. Tap the **download icon** (usually an arrow pointing down) next to the episode. It will download to your phone. You can then listen to it without internet -- perfect for walks, commutes, or when you have no Wi-Fi.

### Step 7: Adjust playback speed

While listening, tap the **playback speed** button (it usually says "1x" on the player screen). You can slow the episode down to 0.5x if the speaker talks fast, or speed it up to 1.5x or 2x if you want to listen more quickly. Try different speeds to find what is comfortable for you.

## Tips

- Start with short episodes (15 to 30 minutes) to get used to the format
- Listen while doing other things like walking, cooking, or cleaning
- Use headphones for better sound quality, especially in noisy places
- If an episode does not grab you in the first few minutes, try a different one -- there are thousands to choose from
- Check the episode date to make sure the information is recent if the topic matters
